# Finding-the-Best-Markets-to-Advertise

I found the best market to create online bootcamp and process advertisement. I used a survey data set which is obtained by freeCodeCamp. I used Pandas to open and explore the data set. I cleaned the data and obtained useful data. 
I used Matplotlib to visualize the interest of roles. I detected extreme outliers while using distribution plot. I cleaned these extreme values, and I got results. I used Saeborn library to create distribution tables.


## Conclusion

The USA has the highest potantial for advertisement. Most of the participants prefer "Web or Mobile Development". Spending volume changes from country to country. People tend to pay 93 dollars in Canada, 65 dollars in India, 45 dollars in the United Kingdom, and 143 dollars in the United States of America.
