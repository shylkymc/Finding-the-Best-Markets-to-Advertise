# Finding-the-Best-Markets-to-Advertise

I found the best market to create online bootcamp and process advertisement. I used a survey data set which is obtained by freeCodeCamp. I used pandas to open and explore data set. I cleaned data and obtained useful data. 
I used matplotlib to visualize the interest of roles. I detected extreme outliers while using distribution plot. I cleaned these extreme values, and I got results. I used seborn library to create distribution tables.


## Conclusion

The USA has the highest potantial for advertisement. Most of the participants prefer "Web or Mobile Development". Spending volume change country to country. People tend to pay 93 dollars in the Canada, 65 dollars in India, 45 dollars in United Kingdom, and 143 dollars in United States of America.
