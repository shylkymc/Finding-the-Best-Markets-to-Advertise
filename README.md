# Finding-the-Best-Markets-to-Advertise

I found the best market to create online bootcamp and process advertisement. I used a survey data set which is obtained by freeCodeCamp. I used pandas to open and explore data set. I cleaned data and obtained useful data. 
I used matplotlib to visualize the interest of roles. I detected extreme outliers while using distribution plot. I cleaned these extreme values, and I got results. I used seborn library to create distribution tables.


## Conclusion

The USA has the highest potantial for advertisement. Most of the participants prefer "Web or Mobile Development".
